Description: `mortality-CUSUM` is an R package for drawing CUSUM plots to monitor a medical center's survival outcomes. CUSUM (CUmulative SUMmation) is a real-time monitor for CUmulative SUMmation of risk-adjusted survival outcomes. We provide O-E CUSUM, one-sided CUSUM, V-mask and reversed CUSUM plots. The resulting plot is designed to simultaneously monitor for failure time outcomes that are worse than expected or better than expected..
